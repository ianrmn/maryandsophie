Zoom by errnio provides a simple and better zoom experience for your Wordpress site images on mobile with isolated magnification, sharing, and image discovery.

== Description ==

**Zoom by errnio** adds an isolated enhanced zoom experience to your site by giving visitors on mobile the option to zoom into any image on your site, without harming your mobile experience. The errnio zoom plugin also adds engagement layer to any image, offering a slide gallery and set of social sharing options to any image, once the user zooms in.

The plugin offers a small zoom icon on the bottom right of your images on any post as a hint. Once the user performs a zooming finger gesture, taps an image, or pinches it, the image is isolated above the post, for optimal zoom. In this mode, additional options are offered, enabling the swiping of other images on the article, and social share buttons.

This tool enhances user experience, engaging your visitors with your content on mobile. errnio can increase your pages per visit, time spent on site, and improve your over site engagement on mobile. Try our other tools and widgets or visit our <a href="http://errnio.com" target="_blank">site</a> for more information.

The plugin offers an admin within errnio, which enable adding more features and plugins to your mobile site, through a simple interface. The plugin is completely FREE and will continue to be.

= Features =

Our main features include enhancement of the following gesture actions:

* **Hint Icon** - Minimal image zoom hints in the form of a zoom icon are added at the bottom right of any relevant page image.
* **Zoom** - Any image is zoomed, isolated from the rest of the site, to a maximum of 130%.
* **Image Swipe** - All images in the pages are assembled into a swiping carousel, offered when the image is zoomed.
* **Share** - In zoom mode, images can be shared via Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp or Mail.


= How it Works =

The **errnio plugin** reaches out to errnio servers and includes the errnio **gesture recognition code**. The gesture recognition code taps into your visitor gestures, performed on your site, and analyses which errnio engagement action. When users perform a zoom gesture on an image on your mobile site, the widget automatically isolates the image for a free zoom experience of the picture.
